  "final_summary": "The merchant's current prep delay is 10 minutes, and they are still accepting orders.\nNext Steps:\n\nCheck Policies:\n\nThe prep delay is 10 minutes, which is below the threshold for:\n\nNotification (min_prep_delay_before_notify: 15 minutes).\nTemporary task assignment (min_prep_delay_for_temp_task_min: 20 minutes).\nReassignment (max_prep_delay_before_reassign: 30 minutes).\nFinding alternatives (max_prep_delay_before_find_alternatives: 60 minutes).\n\n\n\nNo Immediate Action Required:\n\nSince the delay is 10 minutes, no proactive action (e.g., notification, reassignment, or refund) is needed yet.\nThe driver is not yet idle (driver_idle_min: 0), so no temporary task is required.\n\nPlan:\n\nMonitor the situation and re-evaluate if the delay exceeds policy thresholds.\nIf the delay increases to 15+ minutes, notify the customer.\nIf the delay increases to 20+ minutes, consider a temporary task for the driver.\nIf the delay increases to 30+ minutes, consider reassigning the driver or finding alternatives.\n\nFor now, no further action is required. The incident is resolved by observation.",
