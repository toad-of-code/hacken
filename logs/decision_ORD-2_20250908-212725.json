According to the policies and the incident details, the following steps are applicable:\n\nCheck if the delay warrants any action:\n\nThe current delay is 10 minutes, which is below the threshold for:\n\nNotifying the customer (min_prep_delay_before_notify: 15 minutes).\nFinding a temporary task for the idle driver (min_prep_delay_for_temp_task_min: 20 minutes).\nReassigning the driver (max_prep_delay_before_reassign: 30 minutes).\nFinding alternative merchants (max_prep_delay_before_find_alternatives: 60 minutes).\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nNo immediate action is required at this stage, as the delay is within acceptable limits.\n\nThe incident does not meet the criteria for any of the available interventions.\n\n\nMonitoring:\n\nIf the delay increases beyond the thresholds, appropriate actions will be taken based on the policies.\n\nThe incident ORD-2 does not require any further action at this time. I will continue monitoring the situation.",
