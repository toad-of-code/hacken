  "final_summary": "The merchant's current prep delay is 10 minutes, and they are still accepting orders. According to the policies and the incident details, the prep delay is below all thresholds for the following actions:\n- Notification threshold: 15 minutes (min_prep_delay_before_notify).\n- Temporary task threshold: 20 minutes (min_prep_delay_for_temp_task_min).\n- Reassignment threshold: 30 minutes (max_prep_delay_before_reassign).\n- Alternative merchant threshold: 60 minutes (max_prep_delay_before_find_alternatives).\nSince the delay is only 10 minutes, no immediate action is required at this time. However, I will continue monitoring the situation and escalate if the delay worsens.\nFinal Answer:\nThe incident for ORD-2 is currently within acceptable delay limits (10 minutes). No action is required at this time, but the situation will be monitored. If the delay exceeds 15 minutes, proactive steps will be taken.",
